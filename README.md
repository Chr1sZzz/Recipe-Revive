### Create branch

If you didn't fork and will be using the main repo, use branches. (Essentially making a separate folder so it does not interfere with main branch)

To create a new branch: 
- Run `git branch your-branch`
- Checkout into that branch, `git checkout your-branch`

### Pushing

- Add your changes, run `git add .`
- Commit your changes `git commit -m "commit-message"` (Note: the message after -m must be in quotes so it is read as a string)
- To push run, `git push origin your-branch-name`
